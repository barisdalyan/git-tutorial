 **Git** is a distributed revision control system that was made to be fast. Git was created by Linus Torvalds for use in developing the Linux kernel in 2005. Each working directory(project) using the Git version control system is a fully authorized _repository_ that includes whole modified files and version control system whitout central repo or no internet connetion.

Git design was inspired from BitKeeper and Monotone.
It is free and open source software released under the GNU General Public License version 2 software license.

 After installation, we need to configure our Git system.
  ```
  git config --global user.name " your name "
  git config --global user.email " your email address " 
  ```
  To checkout this configuration : 
 ```
 git config --global user.name 
 git config --global user.email 
 ```

 <br/>

To convert our index (folder) to Git project index :
 - ` git init  `	 

To see invisible git file : 
 - `ls -a`

	 width="800" />
 
 <br/>
 
 To add a project files to Git Repository : 
 
 - `git add . or [file name] `

 Code `add` uses to send our project index to **Staging Area** from **Working Directory**. After that, to send the project to **Local Git Repo**, we need to `commit` it. 
 
 - `git commit -m " description "`

 <br/>
 
  To list the versions : 
 
 - `git log `

	 width="600" />

 <br/>

 > _I guess you realized the complicated hash code above, Ä± will mention about this subject in next title._
 
  To see situation of processes between Working Directory and Staging Area :
  
  - ` git status  `
  
  <img src=" https://github.com/barisdalyan/git-tutorial/blob/master/git/img/img_7.png?raw=true" alt="Error"
	 width="600" />
	 
 <br/>	 
 
  To see differs of changed files that are between Working Directory with Git Repo :
  
  - `git diff  [file name]  or . (dot) `

 <img src="https://github.com/barisdalyan/git-tutorial/blob/master/git/img/img_8.png?raw=true" alt="Error"
	 width="600" />
	 
 <br/>
 
  To see differs of changed files that are between Staging Area with Git Repo :
 
  - `git diff --staged ` 
  
  <img src="https://github.com/barisdalyan/git-tutorial/blob/master/git/img/img_9.png?raw=true" alt="Error"
	 width="600" />
 
  <br/>
  
  Code `git rm [file name]` uses for carrying file to Staging Area that had deleted in Working Directory. You don't have to add deleted file to Staging Area again. Code ` git rm -r [folder(index) name]` deletes index and included files.

  <br/>
  
  Code `git mv [[file1 name] [file2 name] or a index]`  uses for carrying file to Staging Area that had renamed in Working Directory. You don't have to add renamed file to Staging Area again.
